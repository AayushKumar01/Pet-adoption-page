      <h3>Meet Jaguar</h3>
      <p>Jaguars kill their prey with one bite
        by piercing the neck of their prey 
       from behind, killing it instantly. 
       And by the way, jaguars and black
        jaguars are the same species; the 
       lack of markings is due to a mutation
        that occurs in approximately 6
         percent of the wild population.</p>

      <p>The brown bear is a large bear

        largest living terrestrial members
